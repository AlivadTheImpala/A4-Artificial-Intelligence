What is AI? 
Today, in the "big data" era, we have the ability to gather enormous amounts of data that would be difficult for a person to process. In this aspect, the use of artificial intelligence has already been highly successful across a number of industries, including technology, banking, marketing, and entertainment.
Artificial intelligence is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to carry out actions frequently associated with intelligent beings is known as artificial intelligence (AI). The phrase is widely used in reference to the effort to create artificial intelligence (AI) systems that possess human-like cognitive abilities like the capacity for reasoning, meaning-finding, generalization, and experience-based learning. Since the advent of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been proven that computers are capable of being expertly programmed to perform extremely difficult tasks, such as finding proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess. Nevertheless, despite ongoing improvements in computer processing speed and memory space, there are currently no programs that can match human adaptability across a larger range of activities or those needing a substantial amount of background knowledge.

history of AI: 
The concept of artificial creatures, mechanical men, and other automatons existing or having the potential to exist was first raised by thinkers in antiquity, which is when artificial intelligence first emerged.
Throughout the 1700s and beyond, early thinkers helped artificial intelligence become more real. Philosophers wondered whether it was possible to artificially automate and control non-human machine intelligence. Classical philosophers, mathematicians, and logicians first investigated the mechanical manipulation of symbols, which eventually sparked interest in AI and led to the development of the Atanasoff Berry Computer (ABC), the first programmable digital computer, in the 1940s. The development of an "electronic brain" or artificially intelligent entity was spurred forward by this particular invention.
Before AI icons contributed to our current understanding of the topic, about ten years had passed. Alan Turing, a mathematician among other things, created a test that determined how well a machine could mimic human behavior. The phrase "artificial intelligence" was first used by computer and cognitive scientist John McCarthy in the middle of that decade during a summer conference held at Dartmouth College.
Many researchers, programmers, logicians, and theorists contributed to the development of the current understanding of artificial intelligence as a whole starting in the 1950s. Every decade brought new discoveries and inventions that altered people's fundamental understanding of artificial intelligence and how historical developments have propelled AI from an impractical fantasy to a viable possibility for both the present and the future.

The importance of AI:
It has long been understood the significance of artificial intelligence and its subsequent elements. They are regarded as methods and instruments for improving the state of the world. And you don't even need to travel to these expensive tech gear to use them. You only need to look around to see that artificial intelligence has likely made the majority of your tasks simple.
It is significant because it makes our lives simpler. These technologies are a huge benefit to people and are designed to minimize human effort. They frequently have the potential to operate automatically. Manual assistance is therefore the absolute last thing that should be requested or seen while operating parts associated with this technology.
This is what makes these machines a valuable and significant tool because they have a tendency to speed up your operations and processes while also providing a level of precision and accuracy that is assured. These technologies and applications are not only relevant to our general and everyday lives; they also contribute to making the world error-free through their straightforward and commonplace ways. It has an effect on and is significant for other fields as well.

AI and Art:
AI and creative work Since the 1960s, there has been a well-established tradition of collaboration between art and technological advancement. As more artists explore AI to assist, improve, imitate, or reproduce creativity, we are witnessing the rise of new artistic forms in which AI is a tool or topic.

Some artists use technology and data as their medium, changing a machine learning model's parameters or a training dataset to produce formal and aesthetic results, or they experiment with new combinations of humans and algorithms.

Ethical Concerns of AI:
Emerging technology raises a number of ethical questions, and the scope and applications of AI pose novel and unprecedented difficulties in the areas of privacy, bias and discrimination, economic power, and justice. For example : 
The disappearance of jobs.
Negative impact on health.
Harm to physical integrity.
Lack of trust.
Ethical Concerns with AI over Bias and Discrimination.
